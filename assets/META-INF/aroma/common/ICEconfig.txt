<b>ICEsound configuration</b>

<*> The configuration file for ICEsound is currently available in five different versions.

<*> Not all five will always be compatible with this device.

<*> This is a way to experiment with a different configuration if ICEsound is preventing other signal processing, like ViPER4Arise for example.

<*> ICEconfig 1 is the default configuration.

<*> ICEconfigs 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are alternative configurations using different settings to hopefully provide at least one satisfactory configuration.

<*> ICEconfig 0 is yet another alternative: using no ICEsound configuration file at all.
