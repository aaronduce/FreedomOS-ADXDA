# This file is used to restore contexts of SuperSU-related files at boot.
#
# While rare, the file contexts do occasionally get lost. You can test it
# out manually by running 'restorecon -R /path/to/this/directory', which
# will reset the file contexts to whatever Android thinks is appropriate.
#
# In the past we modified the list Android uses itself, but this has
# lead to some unexpected behavior on some devices.
#
# Running 'sukernel --restorecon /path/to/this/directory' will apply the
# contexts listed in this file to this directory.
#
# Format: one filename and context pair per line, separated by a single
# space. Filenames are relative to the directory the file_contexts file
# resides in, and may contain subdirectories in their name.
#
# The filename may end with a * to signify a wildcard match, but there
# is no regex support.
#
# Filenames are matched in reverse order (last entry first), so you
# can start the file with a * to set a default.
#
# If a match is not found, the file is labeled u:object_r:system_file:s0.
# SuperSU's own files all need this, so this file is empty other than
# this comment.
#
# Subdirectories may also contain their own file_contexts file (with
# filenames relative to that directory).
#
# This file should have Unix line-endings.
#
# Examples:
#
# * u:object_r:system_file:s0
# frp_date u:object_r:system_file:s0
# supersu_is_here u:object_r:system_file:s0
# bin/* u:object_r:system_file:s0
# lib/* u:object_r:system_file:s0
#
# This file will be overwritten by SuperSU at various times. Add a new
# file_contexts file in the relevant subdirectory if you need to add
# your own entries.
