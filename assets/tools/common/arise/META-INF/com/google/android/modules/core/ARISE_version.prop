## 



## Deuteronomy™ 3.04-2 "SwanSong™" -

 !! Use and make changes to the new one !!


- Added support for a user preferred or custom audio effects configuration to be installed during the Core System module installation using /sdcard/arise_effects.conf if it exists.

- Added four Qualcomm™ audio effects configurations from which one can be selected to install during the Core System module installation using /sdcard/arise_customize.prop:

  - ASUS      (Asus™ Zenfone 3 Deluxe /soundfx)
  - HUAWEI    (Huawei™ Nova Plus, default in Core)
  - SONY      (Sony Xperia XZ /soundfx)
  - STOCK     (Native device firmware /soundfx)


  - Example:


              install.qc.effects=ASUS


  - If desiring to switch Qualcomm™ audio effects configurations after a previous sound system installation, ensure that the Core System module and any other desired module have their necessary values before flashing the zip.

  - This is because the Qualcomm™ audio effects configurations only have entries for the Core System module, optional modules add their entries to this file when installed and remove their entries when uninstalled.

  - Installing the Core System module again over an existing sound system installation will result with only those core entries. Remember this fact when experimenting with the available modules.

Users in search of Add-On's, specifically Dolby Atmos™ with full functionality and Graphic User Interface, can find multiple Dolby Atmos™ ports from the premium device systems currently available like Axon™ 7 Pro and LeTv™ LeMax 2 at our app porter specialist's dedicated @XDA thread at the following address:


http://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software/soundmod-axon-7-dolby-atmos-t3412342


ahrion @XDA Developers is a top-level ARISE Sound Systems™ member and is OP of the Dolby Atmos™ Ports Collective thread linked above. The Dolby Atmos™ zips he's made available are the perfect solution to achieving a seamless Dolby Atmos GUI installation with any ARISE™ sound system. No file in the system will be overwritten and the audio_effects set will remain intact and fully functional via the respectful patching of these files during the installation.


No compromises and no difference whatsoever between an Add-On installation and an ARISE™ sound system with Dolby Atmos™ built-in, except for choices. The Add-On method simply opens the door to numerous build options and experimentation, from the lone processing of ViPER4Android, to the latest experimental Dolby Atmos™ port, possibly multiple simultaneous Dolby Atmos™ installations as his thread evolves, and everything in between. His thread also provides a dedicated resource for Dolby Atmos™ information and support, definitely the better option to be heard and guided by @XDA's finest regarding everything Dolby Atmos™.
